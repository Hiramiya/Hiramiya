## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nasha (she/her), and I never know what to write here, so hi!  
You can usually reach me on twitter @[hiramiyaa](https://twitter.com/hiramiyaa); Though I don't tweet so much anymore, I still check in!

### Currently, professionally:
Working for a little company that you've probably heard of

### Currently, personally:
- Creating tools for streamers and production teams
- A bunch of interactive bots for Discord and Twitch (because there aren't enough of them...)
- Playing around with all sorts of new technology and standards

### Otherwise doing
I stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/hiramiya) sometimes, with a variety of content.

If you like what I do, spare change is warmly accepted on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/hiramiya), but look after yourself first.
