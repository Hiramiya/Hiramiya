## Welcome 👋

I'm Nasha (she/her), and I never know what to write here, so hi!  
You can usually reach me on twitter @[hiramiyaa](https://twitter.com/hiramiyaa); Though I don't tweet so much anymore, I still check in!

### Currently working on
- Documenting a suite of tools, usable for streamers/production companies
- A bunch of interactive bots for Discord and Twitch (because there aren't enough of them...)
- Playing around with all sorts of new technology and standards

### Otherwise doing
I stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/hiramiya) and I'm starting a particularly focused blog ~~soon~~ eventually - no spoilers here! 😁

If you like what I do, spare change is happily accepted on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/E1E61XUP0), but look after yourself first.
