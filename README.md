## Welcome 👋

I'm Nasha (she/her), but it says that over there (<---) so you already got that part..  
You can usually reach me on twitter @[hiramiyaa](https://twitter.com/hiramiyaa); Though I don't tweet so much anymore, I still check in!

### Currently working on
- Helping out on a rust project
- Documenting a suite of tools, usable for streamers/production companies
- A bunch of interactive bots for Discord and Twitch (because there aren't enough of them...)

### Currently learning...
- Rust! It's been too many years since I really used a compiled language..

### Otherwise doing
I stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/hiramiya) and I'm starting a particularly focused blog soon - no spoilers here yet 😁

If you like what I do, spare change is happily accepted:
